Challenges I faced during the assignment:

Mastermind was probably the most difficult module to code for me yet, simply because of the number of things to consider when processing the guesses.

The custom animation is a twist on the original. Instead of falling from the top, I changed the art to animate from the left to right. The logic stays mostly the same, with the major change being movement on the x-axis as opposed to the y-axis in the original code. I use a magic number to set the starting y-position of the animation. To calculate the proper position, e.g. 2 lines above the menu, I would need to "extract" the size of the menu from MenuScreen and then pass it as a parameter to the init function, or figure out another way to set the y-position based on the same principle.

The thing I struggeled the most with is the displaying of the whole game board and then centering the text properly. This whole process is divided into smaller methods for better clarity and readability. I first obtain the the color of the "pegs", by returning a corresponding number from the Colors enum. The same is the case with the evaluation symbols. The second part is returning the actual strings out of from these methods. These helper methods were coded with help from Tony and GitHub Copilot.

The next challenging part of the display was centering this output with the rest of the text in the draw function. After trying different methods, I learned that the reason of misaligned text was using Unicode characters that each have different widths. I was not able to fix this myself, so I turned to Copilot again. The code I am using for centering the text is 100% generated by Copilot.

This is the transcript of my chat with Copilot:

Adam:  
Can you help me center the text in my draw function? The text is centerded when guessSymbols is set to "☆ ☆ ☆ ☆", but is off-center when guessSymbols = GetColoredPegs(guesses[i]); or evaluationSymbols = GetEvaluationSymbols(evaluations[i]);
The problem is that I am using Unicode characters of different width.
How do I keep the text centered all the time?

Copilot explanation of the code:

The provided C# code consists of two methods: CenterText and GetConsoleWidth. These methods are used to center a string in the console output.

The CenterText method takes a string text as an argument. It first gets the width of the console using Console.WindowWidth. Then, it calculates the display width of the text string using the GetConsoleWidth method. The padding needed to center the text is calculated by subtracting the text's width from the console's width and dividing the result by 2. The method then pads the left side of the text string with spaces using the PadLeft method, adding the length of the text to the calculated padding to ensure the text is properly centered. Finally, it pads the right side of the text string with spaces using the PadRight method, ensuring the total length of the string is equal to the console's width. The method returns the padded string, which will be centered when displayed in the console.

The GetConsoleWidth method takes a string str as an argument and calculates its display width in the console. It initializes a width variable to 0 to keep track of the calculated width and a insideEscapeCode boolean variable to false to track whether the current character is part of an ANSI escape code. The method then iterates over each character in the str string. If the character is the start of an ANSI escape code (represented by the Unicode escape character '\u001b'), insideEscapeCode is set to true. If insideEscapeCode is true and the character is the end of an ANSI escape code (represented by the character 'm'), insideEscapeCode is set to false. If insideEscapeCode is false, the method checks if the character is a control character or a surrogate character. If it's neither, it increments the width variable by 1. After iterating over all characters, the method returns the width variable, representing the display width of the str string in the console. This method is particularly useful for accurately calculating the display width of strings that may contain special characters or ANSI escape codes.

Drawbacks of my code:

I am using reverse logic in my AskAndRetriveGuressFromUser function and that is not considered good practice. I ensure the usability of my code by always assuming the input is wrong, unless the condition is met, but this could have been solved more neatly using opposite logic.

For handling the individual colors, I use an enum. Altough not very familiar with enums, after considering different data types and consulting a programming friend, I decided on using Enums to facilitate working with the colors in this program, as they basically behave like numbers in Mastermind. This enables me to use Enum methods for cleaner code.

There are ways of breaking the game, i.e. in the inint function, I do not specifically check for wrong input and the player can break the game there. I would need to add specific validation checks to hanlde wrong input if I wanted to prevent players from entering wrong information.
